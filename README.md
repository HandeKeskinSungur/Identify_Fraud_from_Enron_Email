# Identify Fraud from Enron Email

## Project Overview
The purpose / goal for this project is to use the financial and email data available to us from the Enron Fraud case and determine who are the people of interest and who warrants further investigation. Whilst the data is historic and the people have been already identifed publicly, this project is using Machine Learning to identify these people through the use of data.

In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives.
